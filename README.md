# SyntaxCheck
Safari Extension for Syntax Checking on MDN, currently a mvp

This extension makes it easy to search Mozilla Developer Network. Just click the icon and search.

# Installation

I haven't signed up for a developer account yet. Install it by using the Safari extension builder. If you have any questions send me a message.
